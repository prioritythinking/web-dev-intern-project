# Web Development Internship Project

## To the best of your abilities, please implement these features:
 
- Clicking a numbered button changes the image to the respective number from the sprite sheet called numbersheet.png
- Clicking a numbered button loads the respective HTML content from the includes folder into the \<div id="description"\>
- Clicking the +/- buttons increments up and down, showing the respective image and HTML content
- Construct a new sprite sheet called numbersheet2.png using the individual blue number images
- Clicking the "Switch" button toggles between numbersheet 1 and 2. The functionality of the other buttons should remain intact.
- The page should be styled appropriately and the code should be commented appropriately
